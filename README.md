# GloVe: Global Vectors for Word Representation

## Description

The GloVe (Global Vectors for Word Representation) project implements the GloVe algorithm for generating word embeddings. GloVe is an unsupervised learning algorithm that generates vector representations of words by leveraging word co-occurrence statistics from a corpus. These word embeddings capture semantic meanings and relationships between words, making them useful for various natural language processing (NLP) tasks.

## Features

- **Word Embeddings Generation**: Creates dense vector representations of words using GloVe.
- **Pre-trained Models**: Provides access to pre-trained GloVe embeddings for various corpora and dimensions.
- **Visualization**: Includes tools for visualizing word embeddings in 2D or 3D space.

## Dependencies
